Specific code modifications:

    * MoleculeBind/src/models/components/base_encoders.py
        cleaned-up GCNConv and renamed GCN (model) to GraphEncoder to match the MoleculeBind 
        encoder naming convention
    * MoleculeBind/src/data/utils/graph_utils.py
        most functions are from MolCLR's original source code
        all the functions were cleaned-up for our application
    * MoleculeBind/src/models/components/molclr_lightningmodule.py
        the forward function is taken from the original MolCLR code
        the loss was modified to InfoNCE
